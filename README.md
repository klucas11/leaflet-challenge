# leaflet challenge

This project uses Leafletjs and Mapbox to create an interactive map showcasing eathquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). An API call to the USGS website pulls earthquake data from the last seven days and plots the quake based on location, with the size and color of the marker showing the severity of the event.

### How To Run

* Add your personal API key to the config.js file
* Run index.html on your local server

### Visualization Interactions
* Ability to toggle between map types
* Ability to click on earthquake markers to view location, date, and time
